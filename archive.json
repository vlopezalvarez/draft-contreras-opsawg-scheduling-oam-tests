I recently review draft-ietf-opsawg-scheduling-oam-tests and find this mechanism is very useful, thanks for referencing RFC8969, 3 LIME OAM work and network incident YANG.\nHere is my review and input to draft-ietf-opsawg-scheduling-oam-tests (See attached). I have made lots of editorial changes.Also I fix schema mount related open issues since I feel using test-type case choice is hard to enumerate all possible cases. So my proposed\nChange is to replace test-type cast choice with test-type identity, in addition, add one mount point for you to mount any Device YANG model you like to add. Let me know if you have problem to open this word version with the proposed changes.\n\n[draft-ietf-opsawg-scheduling-oam-tests.docx](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19125505/draft-ietf-opsawg-scheduling-oam-tests.docx)\n\n8< --\n\nproposed YANG from Qin (attached to the mail)\n\nmodule ietf-oam-unitary-test {\n  yang-version 1.1;\n  namespace \"urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:yang:ietf-oam-unitary-test\";\n  prefix \"oamut\";\n\n  // Import OAM models from RFCs RFC8531, RFC8532 and RFC8533\n\n  // reference ietf-netmod-schedule-yang\n  import ietf-schedule {\n    prefix schedule;\n    reference\n      \"RFC XXXX: A Common YANG Data Model for Scheduling\";\n  }\n\n  import ietf-routing-types {\n    prefix rt-types;\n    reference\n      \"RFC 8294: Common YANG Data Types for the Routing Area\";\n  }\n  \n   import ietf-yang-schema-mount {\n     prefix yangmnt;\n     reference\n       \"RFC 8528: YANG Schema Mount\";\n   }\n\n  organization\n    \"IETF OPSAWG (Operations and Management Area Working Group)\";\n\n  contact\n    \"WG Web:   <https://datatracker.ietf.org/wg/opsawg/>\n     WG List:  <mailto:opsawg@ietf.org>\n     Author: Luis Miguel Contreras Murillo\n          <luismiguel.contrerasmurillo@telefonica.com>\n     Author: Victor Lopez\n          <victor.lopez@nokia.com>\";\n  description\n    \"This module defines the 'ietf-oam-unitary-test' YANG model for\n     activation of network diagnosis procedures.\n\n    Copyright (c) 2024 IETF Trust and the persons identified as\n    authors of the code.
