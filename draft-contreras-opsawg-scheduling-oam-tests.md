--- abstract

This document defines a YANG data model for network diagnosis on-demand using Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) tests. This document defines both 'oam-unitary-test' and 'oam-test-sequence' data models to enable on-demand activation of network diagnosis procedures.

The YANG data model defined in this document conforms to the Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA).
